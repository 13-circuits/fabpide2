fabpide2 is a PCB kit that breaks out Stand-alone USB PD sink controller
[STUSB4500](https://www.st.com/en/interfaces-and-transceivers/stusb4500.html)
by STMicroelectronics.

You can [buy this kit from
tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/18263/).

# Flash configuration

You need the [official GUI
app](https://github.com/usb-c/STUSB4500/tree/master/GUI) to generate
configuration values which can then be flashed using an Arduino via I2C
bus. An arduino sketch is provided here for this purpose.

# Is this open source?

Not yet as I need to clean things up quite a bit. Once done, I will
include all the design files in KiCad as well as ready to manufacture
gerber files.
